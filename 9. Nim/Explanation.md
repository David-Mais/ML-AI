# Explanation of the Q-Learning Functions for NimAI

This document details the Q-learning functions implemented for the NimAI. These functions enable the AI to evaluate, update, and select actions based on Q-values during training. Each function plays a crucial role in the learning process through the Q-learning algorithm.

---

## Overview of the Code

The provided code consists of four primary functions:

1. **`get_q_value`**  
   Retrieves the Q-value for a given state and action pair from the Q-table. If no Q-value exists yet, it returns 0.

2. **`update_q_value`**  
   Updates the Q-value for a state-action pair by applying the Q-learning formula, which factors in the learning rate, immediate reward, and estimated future rewards.

3. **`best_future_reward`**  
   Calculates the maximum Q-value among all possible actions in a given state. This value represents the best estimate for future rewards.

4. **`choose_action`**  
   Chooses an action for the AI based on the current state. It uses an epsilon-greedy strategy: with probability `epsilon`, it picks a random action; otherwise, it selects the action with the highest Q-value. Ties are broken randomly.

## Detailed Code Explanation

### 1. `get_q_value`

**Purpose:**  
This function fetches the Q-value corresponding to a particular `(state, action)` pair from the internal Q-table (`self.q`). The state and action are converted into tuples so that they can be used as dictionary keys. If the Q-value does not exist in `self.q`, the function returns 0 as the default value.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
def get_q_value(self, state, action):
    """
    Return the Q-value for the state `state` and the action `action`.
    If no Q-value exists yet in `self.q`, return 0.
    """
    return self.q.get((tuple(state), tuple(action)), 0)
```

**Explanation:**  
- **State and Action Conversion:**  
  The state (usually a list) and the action are converted to tuples so they can be used as keys in the dictionary.
- **Default Value:**  
  If the key is not present in the `self.q` dictionary, the method returns 0, representing an uninitialized Q-value.

---

### 2. `update_q_value`

**Purpose:**  
This function updates the Q-value for a given `(state, action)` pair using the Q-learning update rule. The update considers both the immediate reward from the action and the estimate of future rewards, scaled by the learning rate (`self.alpha`).

**Code Snippet:**

```python
def update_q_value(self, state, action, old_q, reward, future_rewards):
    """
    Update the Q-value for the state `state` and the action `action`
    given the previous Q-value `old_q`, a current reward `reward`,
    and an estiamte of future rewards `future_rewards`.

    Use the formula:

    Q(s, a) <- old value estimate
               + alpha * (new value estimate - old value estimate)

    where `old value estimate` is the previous Q-value,
    `alpha` is the learning rate, and `new value estimate`
    is the sum of the current reward and estimated future rewards.
    """
    print(f"Old Q-value: {old_q}")
    print(f"New Q-value: {reward}")
    print(f"Estimated future rewards: {future_rewards}")
    new_q = old_q + self.alpha * ((reward + future_rewards) - old_q)
    self.q[(tuple(state), tuple(action))] = new_q
```

**Explanation:**  
- **Debugging Output:**  
  The function prints the old Q-value, the immediate reward, and the estimated future rewards for debugging purposes.
- **Q-value Update:**  
  The update is performed using the formula:  
  $
  Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \times \left((\text{reward} + \text{future_rewards}) - Q(s, a)\right)
  $
  This formula adjusts the existing Q-value closer to the new value estimate.
- **Saving the New Q-value:**  
  The updated Q-value is then stored in `self.q` using the tuple representation of `(state, action)` as the key.

### 3. `best_future_reward`

**Purpose:**  
This function calculates the maximum Q-value among all possible actions in a given state. It returns 0 if there are no available actions or if none of the state-action pairs have been visited before.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
def best_future_reward(self, state):
    """
    Given a state `state`, consider all possible `(state, action)`
    pairs available in that state and return the maximum of all
    of their Q-values.

    Use 0 as the Q-value if a `(state, action)` pair has no
    Q-value in `self.q`. If there are no available actions in
    `state`, return 0.
    """
    actions = Nim.available_actions(state)
    if not actions:
        return 0
    return max(self.get_q_value(state, action) for action in actions)
```

**Explanation:**  
- **Retrieving Available Actions:**  
  The function calls `Nim.available_actions(state)` to get a set of all possible actions from the current state.
- **Edge Case Handling:**  
  If there are no available actions, the function returns 0.
- **Evaluation:**  
  For each possible action, the function retrieves its Q-value using `get_q_value`. The maximum Q-value among these is returned, representing the best expected future reward.

---

### 4. `choose_action`

**Purpose:**  
This function selects an action from the available actions in a given state. It uses an epsilon-greedy strategy:
- With probability `self.epsilon`, a random action is chosen (exploration).
- Otherwise, it selects the action with the highest Q-value (exploitation).

**Code Snippet:**

```python
def choose_action(self, state, epsilon=True):
    """
    Given a state `state`, return an action `(i, j)` to take.

    If `epsilon` is `False`, then return the best action
    available in the state (the one with the highest Q-value,
    using 0 for pairs that have no Q-values).

    If `epsilon` is `True`, then with probability
    `self.epsilon` choose a random available action,
    otherwise choose the best action available.

    If multiple actions have the same Q-value, any of those
    options is an acceptable return value.
    """
    actions = list(Nim.available_actions(state))
    if not actions:
        return None

    if epsilon and random.random() < self.epsilon:
        return random.choice(actions)

    q_values = []
    for action in actions:
        q = self.get_q_value(state, action)
        q_values.append(q)

    max_q = max(q_values)
    best_actions = []
    for i in range(len(actions)):
        if q_values[i] == max_q:
            best_actions.append(actions[i])

    return random.choice(best_actions)
```

**Explanation:**  
- **Action Availability:**  
  The function first checks if there are any available actions. If not, it returns `None`.
- **Epsilon-Greedy Strategy:**  
  - If `epsilon` is `True` and a randomly generated number is less than `self.epsilon`, the function chooses a random action, encouraging exploration.
  - Otherwise, it evaluates the Q-values for each available action.
- **Selecting the Best Action:**  
  It compiles a list of actions that share the highest Q-value. If more than one action ties for the best, one is randomly chosen from this list.
- **Returning the Action:**  
  The chosen action is returned, ensuring that the AI either exploits its current knowledge or explores a new strategy according to the epsilon parameter.

## Conclusion

The combination of these functions underpins the NimAI's ability to learn and improve over time using Q-learning. The `get_q_value` function retrieves the current estimates, while the `update_q_value` function adjusts these estimates based on new experiences. The `best_future_reward` function provides a forecast of optimal future outcomes from a given state, and `choose_action` smartly balances exploration and exploitation through an epsilon-greedy policy.
