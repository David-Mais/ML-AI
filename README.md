# Welcome to My AI & Machine Learning Projects!

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm diving into the exciting world of AI and machine learning, inspired by the CS50 AI course. This repository is where Iâ€™m building and experimenting with different projects that explore everything from game-playing algorithms (like our cool tic-tac-toe bot) to other awesome AI concepts.

## What's in This Repo?

- **Project Implementations**  
  - Various projects showcasing different AI and machine learning techniques.
  - Detailed code explanations and walkthroughs (like the minimax tic-tac-toe example) to help you understand the inner workings.

- **Explanation Files**  
  - Step-by-step markdown files that break down the code.
  - Casual, easy-to-read guides so you can follow along without feeling overwhelmed.

- **Experimentation & Learning**  
  - A space where I tinker with algorithms and test out new ideas.
  - Regular updates as I learn and improve the projects.

## How to Use This Repository

### Getting Started
- **Clone the Repo:**  
  Simply clone the repository to your local machine using:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
  ```
- **Explore the Projects:**  
  Each project is organized in its own folder. Check out the README files in those folders for specific setup instructions and usage examples.

### Running the Projects
- **Dependencies:**  
  Most projects are Python-based. Make sure you have Python installed along with any required libraries. You can often find a `requirements.txt` file in the project folder:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- **Execute the Code:**  
  Follow the instructions in each projectâ€™s README to run the scripts. For instance, if you want to see the tic-tac-toe AI in action, navigate to that folder and run:
  ```bash
  python runner.py
  ```

### Understanding the Explanation Files
- **Detailed Guides:**  
  Files like `explanation.md` break down the code into digestible sections:
  - **Introduction:** What the code is about.
  - **Core Logic:** Step-by-step explanation of how the code works.
  - **Conclusion:** Summarizes the learning points.
- **Use Them as a Study Aid:**  
  Read through these files to get a better grasp of the concepts, or use them as a quick reference when tinkering with your own projects.
