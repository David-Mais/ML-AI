# Introduction

The goal of this exercise was to practice transforming sentences in natural language into a logical form—specifically, propositional logic.

---

# Detailed Code Explanation

Since all the logical connectives were already given, I won't go through each of them one by one. For reference, we had the following definitions:

- **Negation:**  
  $$\lnot = \text{Not()}$$

- **Conjunction:**  
  $$\land = \text{And()}$$

- **Disjunction:**  
  $$\lor = \text{Or()}$$

- **Implication:**  
  $$\rightarrow = \text{Implication()}$$

- **Biconditional:**  
  $$\iff = \text{Biconditional()}$$

## Representing Knowledge

In this section, I describe the process of representing four logical sentences 
using the notation defined above.

### Knowledge 0: A Says "I am both a knight and a knave."

1. **Game Rules Definition:**  
   First, I defined that `A` can be either a Knight or a Knave but not both at 
   the same time. This aligns with the rules of the game.

2. **Logical Representation:**  
   Next, I represented the statement: "If A is telling the truth, then he is 
   both a knight and a knave." In propositional logic, this was expressed as:
   
   - **A is a knight if and only if he is both a knight and a knave.**
   
   Since the game rules state that one cannot be both, we deduce that A must be 
   lying thus, he is a knave.

3. **Code Implementation:**

   ```python
   knowledge0 = And(
       And(Or(AKnight, AKnave), Not(And(AKnight, AKnave))),
       Biconditional(AKnight, And(AKnight, AKnave))
   )
   ```

This code snippet combines the rules of the game with the logical statement to derive 
the appropriate conclusion about A's status. 


### Knowledge 1: A says "We are both knaves.", B says nothing

1. **Game Rules Definition:**  
   - As in the previous puzzle, start by defining the game rules for character A.  
   - Since character B is now involved, add similar rules for B.

2. **Logical Representation:**  
   - **If A is telling the truth:** Both A and B are knaves.  
     - Expressed as:  
       $$AKnight \rightarrow (AKnave \land BKnave)$$
   - **If A is lying:** A and B are not both knaves.  
     - Expressed as:  
       $$AKnave \rightarrow \lnot (AKnave \land BKnave)$$

3. **Code Implementation:**

   ```python
   knowledge1 = And(
       And(Or(AKnight, AKnave), Not(And(AKnight, AKnave))),
       And(Or(BKnight, BKnave), Not(And(BKnight, BKnave))),
       Implication(AKnight, And(AKnave, BKnave)),
       Implication(AKnave, Not(And(AKnave, BKnave)))
   )
   ```

---

### Knowledge 2: A says "We are the same kind." B says "We are of different kinds."

1. **Game Rules Definition:**  
   - The same game rules apply as in the previous example for both A and B.

2. **Logical Representation:**  
   - **If A is telling the truth:**  
     - Either both are knights or both are knaves, represented using the biconditional:
       $$AKnight \iff \bigl((AKnight \land BKnight) \lor (AKnave \land BKnave)\bigr)$$  
   - **If B is a knight (telling the truth):**  
     - Then his statement indicates that they are not the same kind:
       $$BKnight \iff \lnot \bigl((AKnight \land BKnight) \lor (AKnave \land BKnave)\bigr)$$

3. **Code Implementation:**

   ```python
   knowledge2 = And(
       And(Or(AKnight, AKnave), Not(And(AKnight, AKnave))),
       And(Or(BKnight, BKnave), Not(And(BKnight, BKnave))),
       Biconditional(AKnight, Or(And(AKnight, BKnight), And(AKnave, BKnave))),
       Biconditional(BKnight, Not(Or(And(AKnight, BKnight), And(AKnave, BKnave))))
   )
   ```

### Knowledge 3:  
_A says either "I am a knight." or "I am a knave." (you don't know which)._  
_B says "A said 'I am a knave'." and "C is a knave."_  
_C says "A is a knight."_

1. **Game Rule Definition:**  
   - Define the game rules for characters A and B as before.
   - Add the same rule for the new character C.

2. **Logical Representation:**  
   - **B’s Statement on C:**  
     - If B is telling the truth, then C is a knave; if B is lying, then C is not a knave (i.e., C is a knight):  
       $$BKnight \iff CKnave$$
   - **C’s Statement on A:**  
     - If C is telling the truth, then A is a knight; if C is lying, then A is a knave:  
       $$CKnight \iff AKnight$$
   - **B’s Report of A’s Statement:**  
     - If B is truthful, then A indeed said "I am a knave."  
     - If B is lying, then A did not say that (which, due to the logical structure, makes the implication trivially true):  
       $$BKnight \rightarrow (AKnight \iff AKnave)$$

3. **Code Implementation:**

   ```python
   knowledge3 = And(
       And(Or(AKnight, AKnave), Not(And(AKnight, AKnave))),
       And(Or(BKnight, BKnave), Not(And(BKnight, BKnave))),
       And(Or(CKnight, CKnave), Not(And(CKnight, CKnave))),
       Biconditional(BKnight, CKnave),
       Biconditional(CKnight, AKnight),
       Implication(BKnight, Biconditional(AKnight, AKnave))
   )
   ```

# Conclusion

This exercise provided a practical way to translate natural language statements into 
precise logical expressions. By systematically defining game rules and representing 
each character's assertions using propositional logic, we were able to clearly analyze 
and determine the consistency of their statements. Overall, the process reinforced the 
importance of breaking down complex statements into manageable logical components, helping 
us understand both the limits and capabilities of formal reasoning in everyday language.
